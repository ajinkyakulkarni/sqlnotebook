<h1>How to Import a CSV File</h1>
<p>
CSV (comma-separated value) is a common tabular data exchange format.  In order to import such a file into SQL Notebook, the file must have a <tt>.CSV</tt> file extension.
</p>
<h3>Step 1: Check for a header row</h3>
<p>
SQL Notebook needs to know whether the file includes column names in the first line.  To find out, open the <tt>.CSV</tt> file in a text editor or Excel.  The following example shows the top of a CSV file in Excel.  <tt>playerID</tt>, <tt>yearid</tt>, etc. are column names, not row data, and thus this file does contain column names in the first line.

</div>
<p>
If the file does not specify column names (and instead has data starting immediately at row 1), then SQL Notebook will automatically create unpleasantly generic column names.  SQLite does not offer the ability to rename columns after a table has been created, so your options when importing a CSV file that lacks column names are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Edit the file before importing to include column names.  (Recommended)</li>
<li>Use the <tt>CREATE VIEW</tt> command afterwards to give these columns more descriptive names.</li>
<li>Just live with the auto-generated column names.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 2: Set up the import</h3>
<p>
In SQL Notebook, click the "Import" button and then click the "From file..." menu command.  A file chooser dialog box will appear.  Choose your <tt>.CSV</tt> file and click "Open."  SQL Notebook will read the file and open the "Import" dialog, as shown below.

</div>
<p>
If your file does not specify column names in the first row (see step 1), then uncheck the "This file has a header row" checkbox (marked "A" in Fig. 2 above).
</p><p>
By default, the CSV file will be imported into an SQL table with the same name as the file.  If another table name is desired, then click the table name in the "Tables to import" list, and then click the "Rename..." button (marked "B" in Fig. 2 above).  The chosen name must not already exist in the notebook.
</p><p>
When you are satisfied with these settings, click the "Import" button (marked "C" in Fig. 2 above) to copy the CSV data into the notebook.  Depending on the size of the file, it may take some time for the data to be imported.
</p>
<h3>Step 3: Confirm results</h3>
<p>
Double-click on the new table in the "Table of Contents" pane (by default, on the left side of the application).  This will open a preview window, showing up to 1000 rows of data.  If the data looks good, you are done!  If not, then delete the table (by right-clicking on the table name in the "Table of Contents" pane and choosing "Delete" from the context menu) and try the import process again.
