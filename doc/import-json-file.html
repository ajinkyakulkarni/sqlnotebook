<h1>How to Import a JSON File</h1>
<p>
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a hierarchical data exchange format commonly used in web services.  The hierarchical object structure does not map directly into a tabular format, but SQL Notebook's import process aims to produce a reasonable result given an arbitrary JSON input file.
</p><p>
In order to import a JSON file into SQL Notebook, it must have a <tt>.JSON</tt> file extension.
</p>
<h3>Step 1: Find the relevant array</h3>
<p>
The JSON import process converts an array in the JSON file into an SQL table.  In the simplest case, the whole JSON file is just an array like <tt>[1, 2, 3]</tt>.  But more commonly, the JSON file is an object that contains an array somewhere, and that array is what the user is interested in.

<p>
The above diagram illustrates the structure of a typical JSON file.  This file, containing search results from Stack Overflow, contains one large array with all of the search results that we are interested in.  However, each of the search results also contains its own array listing the tags (like "C#", "WPF", etc.) for that Stack Overflow question.  SQL Notebook allows the user to choose any array from the input file, but typically we are only interested in the outermost array, which appears first in the "Import" dialog's list of tables.
</p>
<h3>Step 2: Import the array</h3>
<p>
In SQL Notebook, click the "Import" button and then click the "From file..." menu command.  A file chooser dialog box will appear.  Choose your <tt>.JSON</tt> file and click "Open."  SQL Notebook will read the file and open the "Import" dialog, as shown in Fig. 1 above.
</p><p>
Typically, the first table listed in the "Tables to import" box is the one the user is interested in.  Click the name of the desired table (probably the first one) and check the corresponding checkbox.  To give the table a more descriptive name, click the "Rename..." button.
</p><p>
When you are satisfied with these settings, click the "Import" button to copy the JSON data into the notebook.  Depending on the size of the file, it may take some time for the data to be imported.
</p>
<h3>Step 3: Confirm results</h3>
<p>
Double-click on the new table in the "Table of Contents" pane (by default, on the left side of the application).  This will open a preview window, showing up to 1000 rows of data.  If the data looks good, you are done!  If not, then delete the table (by right-clicking on the table name in the "Table of Contents" pane and choosing "Delete" from the context menu) and try the import process again.
