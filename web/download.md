### [Download Installer .EXE (preferred)](https://sqlnotebook.com/install/setup.exe)

This is a [ClickOnce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClickOnce) installer.  It will install all necessary prerequisites, and SQL Notebook will automatically check for updates.

### [Download Portable .ZIP](https://sqlnotebook.com/install/SqlNotebook_0_5_0_0.zip)

This portable app does not require installation.  You must already have [.NET Framework 4.6](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49981) and the [Visual C++ 2015 runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145) installed.  This version of SQL Notebook will *not* check for updates.  Come back to this page to download new versions.

### Instructions

Because SQL Notebook is a fresh new application that Microsoft has not seen before, the installation may trigger a Windows SmartScreen block.  These prompts will eventually go away as Microsoft registers more downloads for the application.  Until then, the prompt can be bypassed:
