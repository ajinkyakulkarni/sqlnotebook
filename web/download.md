# Download & Install

The current version is **0.4** and was released on **April 17, 2016**.

### [Download ClickOnce Installer](https://sqlnotebook.com/install/setup.exe)

This is an .EXE installer.  It will install all necessary prerequisites, and SQL Notebook will automatically check for updates.  This is the preferred method.

### [Download Portable .ZIP](https://sqlnotebook.com/install/SqlNotebook_0_4_0_0.zip)

This portable app does not require installation.  You must already have [.NET Framework 4.6](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49981) and the [Visual C++ 2015 runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145) installed.  This version of SQL Notebook will *not* check for updates.  Come back to this page to download new versions.
